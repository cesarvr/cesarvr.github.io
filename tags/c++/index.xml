      <description>What is this post about This post is basically about how to create your own container program using C.

Why C Because I love the simplicity of the language (maybe I&amp;rsquo;m just a romantic) and also it is the lingua franca of Linux, which means that it helps to get a better understanding about how things work at a system level.</description>
