      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of my hobbies is to write (and sometimes re-write) graphics engines. I do this because I love the challenge of writing not only fast code but scalable code and also because I like visual stuff. This time I decide to write one in JavaScript using WebGL and as soon as I have a workable set of API&amp;rsquo;s I decide to write an simple vortex animation to see how well my new shinny new engine will perform.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Why Some of my work at Red Hat is to design and develop end-to-end mobile/desktop application using Apache Cordova and using Node.JS, One of the typical challenges I face, when working with some costumer, is how to generate reports in PDF format, the usual way to solve this was to use a server side API render the document there and send it to the phone, this is not nice, the first reason, you need network connectivity for this to work, the second is the lack of good and free PDF API&amp;rsquo;s in the server side, so I decide to write a plugin to move this job to the mobile device, the advantages of doing this are:</description>

      <description>Building V8 Javascript Engine. Introduction I was thinking sometime ago about starting hacking with V8, aside from the fact that I work every day with Javascript, is that the Chromium engineers are doing a very good job making V8 fast and efficient and for some task good Javascript code is faster than C++, here is a great talk about the sophisticated JIT generation in Javascript.
After many days of procrastination, I put my hands-on and start the task of downloading the project and prayed that everything would just work, like many things in life it didn&amp;rsquo;t work the first time, here I documented all the steps, if somebody wants to start playing with this, hopefully this will make their life easy.</description>
